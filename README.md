## About

Economics graduate with a strong applied statistics foundation. I build the systems that make analysis reliable, not just the analysis itself.

My work sits at the intersection of economic reasoning (margins, incentives, constraints) and practical data engineering in Python and SQL. I turn multi-source operational data into clean, auditable datasets and decision-ready dashboards.

## Impact

- Designed and implemented a **multi-source ETL pipeline** (Bronze → Silver → Gold), standardizing 100% of platform sales into a unified analytics model
- Built **unit economics and margin analysis** frameworks, improving gross margin visibility across 3 sales channels
- Developed **Power BI dashboards** that influenced pricing and operational decisions for a real food business
- Built a **custom POS application** that replaced pen-and-paper order logging with digital inventory, data capture, and thermal printing

---

## Flagship Project

Built and currently maintaining a production-style analytics system for a multi-platform food business, used for weekly business decisions:

- **Bronze → Silver → Gold** ETL architecture in Python
- Multi-source order ingestion and normalization (full platform universe, not just in-house records)
- Net revenue, COGS, and margin modeling with reconciliation and issue tracking
- Power BI model focused on decision KPIs for business owners
